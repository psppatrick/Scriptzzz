# Scriptzzz
These are general Bash scripts written as I learn scripting (Some are bad, some are made because I'm lazy. Most are untested).

The general scripts are found here, anything in the ARMBuildScripts are relating to one of my other repo's custom-kali-variant-rektv1

The OpenVPNSetUpScripts are very much guesswork at the moment, when I have an internet facing apache server I'll actually test them.
